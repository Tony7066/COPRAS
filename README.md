# COPRAS
A  multi criteria decision making technique 

COPRAS (COmplex PRoportional Assessment of alternatives) is a MultiCriteria Decision Making (MCDM) method used to evaluate and rank
alternatives based on multiple criteria. MCDM methods are useful when 
decision-makers need to consider various factors or criteria in order to make 
informed decisions.

COPRAS is a method that aims to handle complex decision-making problems 
where there are multiple criteria that need to be considered. It involves a 
series of steps to assess and rank alternatives based on their performance 
across the criteria.

Features and content of program: this programs algorithm is quite simple.
All the steps are mentioned int the program itself. Program demands a matrix 
whose rows represents some alternative and columns represent multiple 
criteria of that alternative. Then program prompts user to input the weights of 
every criteria. Program than returns the utility index and finally the rank of all 
alternatives. Higher the utility index, lower the rank, better is the alternative.

Using this program we tried to estimate ;

1. The optimal way for road construction (taking its layout into consideration).
2. An automatic signal which works efficiently by deciding time of operation by 
considering all situation in traffic
